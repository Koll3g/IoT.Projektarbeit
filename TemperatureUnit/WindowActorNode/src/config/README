## Brief overview

This folder allows application and location specific configuration. There is a template-
configuration available in the `.\default` folder, giving you templates for the various
files. Your local configuration resides in the `.\local` folder.

As your local configuration may contain secrets (e.g. your WiFi password or your
credentials), the `.\local` folder is excluded from version control by a
corresponding `.gitignore`-clause.

## Create application specific configurations

Whenever you want to adopt to your specific environment (e.g. in order to access
your local WiFi Network), simply execute the following steps:

1. Copy the specific file from the `.\default` folder into your `.\local` folder.
2. Adjust the copyright notice and the author
3. Remove the "do not edit" warning
4. Adjust the settings according to your needs
